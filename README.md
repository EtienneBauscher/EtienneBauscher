ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Etienne
I'm a software engineer with a strong focus on .NET backend development and Flutter frontend applications. I prioritize secure data handling, leveraging encrypted database models and structured DTOs for clean and efficient architectures.

ðŸ”¹ Backend: .NET 8, Database Encryption, Secure API Design
ðŸ”¹ Frontend: Flutter, GoRouter, Encrypted Navigation
ðŸ”¹ Principles: Scalable Solutions, Separation of Concerns, Pragmatic Refactoring

Currently, I'm working on a business concept to provide oversight services for outsourced software projects, ensuring quality, transparency, and delivery.

ðŸš€ Always exploring better ways to build robust, secure, and maintainable software.
